# Interactive Periodic Table

### The periodic table is a crucial resource for students and researchers in chemistry. <be> However, traditional static periodic tables often lack interactivity, adaptability across devices, and features to cater to diverse user needs. This limitation hinders accessibility and engagement, especially in modern educational contexts. The goal of this project is to create an Interactive Periodic Table using Bootstrap to overcome these challenges by ensuring responsiveness, modern design, and a user-friendly interface. The table should display chemical elements with detailed information, allow users to interact seamlessly, and adapt perfectly to different screen sizes for optimal usability.
